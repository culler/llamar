    Parses a config file with sections corresponding to network
    interfaces.

    This object provides methods get_address and get_name, which map
    hostnames to addresses and addresses to hostnames, respectively.
    There are separate mappings for IPv4 and IPv6.  The mappings are
    determined by parsing the config file at the time when the object
    is instantiated and are fixed for the life of the object.

    If the config file contains a section for an interface, but does
    not provide a name, then the responder will assign the name returned
    by uname -n.

    If the config file has a section for an interface then the mapping
    assigns the primary address for that interface to the name.  The
    mapping from addresses to names only returns a name for the
    primary address.  Secondary addresses are ignored.
